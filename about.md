I think Germany is a beautiful country to be in. We live in the South East, slap between Munich and the Bavarian Alps. Depending on season we Nordic ski the trails and mountain bike the forest roads. Some absolutely idyllic villages, lakes, and mountain vistas are to be seen here. Through the year they have beautiful traditions, which barely change year to year.
